[Documentation](https://docs.rs/fail)

A fail point implementation for Rust.

Fail point is a code point that are used to inject errors by users at runtime.
This crate is inspired by FreeBSD's [failpoints](https://freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fail).

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fail = "0.2"
```

Next, add the following code to your crate:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate fail;
```

Define the fail points:

```
fn function_return_tuple() {
    fail_point!("name1");
}

fn function_return_others() -> u64 {
    fail_point!("name2", |r| r.map_or(2, |e| e.parse().unwrap()));
    0
}

fn function_conditional(enable: bool) {
    fail_point!("name3", enable, |_| {});
}
```

Trigger a fail point via the environment variable:

```
$ FAILPOINTS=foo=panic cargo run
```

In unit tests:

```
#[test]
fn test_foo() {
    fail::cfg("foo", "panic");
    foo();
}
```

## Caveats

Before putting any fail points, you should carefully consider the consequences.
A list of suggestions you should keep in mind:

 - **Enable** the no_fail feature in the release build.
 - Be careful about the complex combination.
 - Be careful about the fail point name and make sure it is self-described.
 - Fail points might have the same name, and in this case, they take the same actions.

## To Do

Triggering a fail point via the HTTP API is planned but not implemented yet.
